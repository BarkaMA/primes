Usage:

this script can help find prime numbers by 2 methods :
    1) you spesify an interval where you want to find primes 
    2) you spesify a starting point then the amount of primes to find

Required packages:

    - 'math' is the only package used for counting square root 'sqrt' so you need to have it on your envirenment

Note:
    i found some over time consuming when the interval passes 1 million, am thankful any advices to improve it
